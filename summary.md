# Summary

In this Python project, we have implemented a CNN-RNN model by building an image caption generator. Some key points to note are that our model depends on the data, so, it cannot predict the words that are out of its vocabulary. We used a small dataset consisting of 8000 images. For production-level models, we need to train on datasets larger than 100,000 images which can produce better accuracy models.



The results of the image captioning model is as follows
